                          :Taste

Being raised in a country which prides itself on its spices, flavours and aromas emanating from its world-known delicacies, my tastes wanders from sweet and bland to spicy and salty.
So here is a meal you ought to try! Chosen by me of course! - 

**BUTTER CHICKEN / MURGH MAKANI**

This dish may seem _simple_, but don't judge it just be its fiery orange hue! It is slightly sweet, very buttery and totally tantalising! 

    The heavenly aroma wafting from this dish is what first draws you to it. 
    It is even a feast for the eyes! Attractive fiery to calm mellow orange radiates off the dish. Your mouth simply can't help but water.
    When you sink into the dish [metaphorically], you just keep asking for more and more naan bread. Yes, it is that enchanting!

I would carry on, but this may turn out to be a love letter to the dish rather than a personal essay.
